		<b>Your gift helps HandsOn Bay Area deliver quality volunteer experiences across the Bay Area. Yearly, we mobilize over 16,000 volunteers to provide 55,000 hours of service! Without your generous support, none of this would be possible. Together we can address the most pressing needs in our community.With your generous donation, students and community members will have access to over 100 nonprofits located in San Francisco, and the opportunities they provide. They will be able to share their unique talents, and give back to their community through volunteer work and student internships. IYD has averaged $1.2 million of volunteer work back into San Francisco with the help of donors like you!</b></font>
